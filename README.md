# Pomodoro App built with TypeScript and ReactJS

This project is a Pomodoro app built with TypeScript and React.js

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The original technique has six steps:
1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the Pomodoro timer (25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (5 minutes).
5. If you have finished fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros, completing a total of four pomodoros (four 25 minutes timers + three 5 minutes short breaks).
6. After the fourth pomodoro is done, take a long break (15 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2 (start a new cycle).
